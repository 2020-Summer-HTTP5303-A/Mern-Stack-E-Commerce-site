# How to use Bootstrap in react

If you are using a build tool or a module bundler such as webpack, then this is the preferred option for adding Bootstrap to your React application. You will need to install Bootstrap as a dependency for your app.

     npm install bootstrap
     

Or if you are using Yarn:

    yarn add bootstrap
    
    
Once you have Bootstrap installed, you will go ahead to include it to your app’s entry JavaScript file. If you are used to create-react-app, this should be your src/index.js file.

      import 'bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css';
      import React from 'react';
      import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
      import './index.css';
      import App from './App';
      import registerServiceWorker from './registerServiceWorker';

      ReactDOM.render(<App />, document.getElementById('root'));
      registerServiceWorker();
      
Notice that we have imported the Bootstrap minified CSS as the first dependency. With this, we can go ahead using the built-in Bootstrap classes in our React app components. However, before you can use Bootstrap’s JavaScript components in your app, you’ll need to install jquery and popper.js if they are not already installed.

      npm install jquery popper.js

Next, you will make additional changes to the src/index.js file to add the new dependencies as shown in the following snippet.

      import 'bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css';
      import $ from 'jquery';
      import Popper from 'popper.js';
      import 'bootstrap/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min';
      import React from 'react';
      import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
      import './index.css';
      import App from './App';
      import registerServiceWorker from './registerServiceWorker';

      ReactDOM.render(<Dropdown />, document.getElementById('root'));
      registerServiceWorker();

Here we added imports for $ and Popper. We also imported the Bootstrap JavaScript minified bundle file. Now you can use Bootstrap JavaScript components in your React app.
