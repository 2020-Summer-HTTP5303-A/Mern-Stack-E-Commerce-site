 # A Short Explaination for React Components,Routers and Routing
 ### components
Components are the building blocks of any React app and a typical React app will have many of these. Simply put, a component is a JavaScript class or function that optionally accepts inputs i.e. properties(props) and returns a React element that describes how a section of the UI (User Interface) should appear.

### Simple example of Component for understanding
    const Greeting = () => <h1>Hello World today!</h1>;
This is a functional component (called Greeting) written using ES6’s arrow function syntax that takes no props and returns an H1 tag with the text “Hello World today!”

### Routing
Is the process of resource navigation in a web app. This is how your app determines what to do with a client request. For example:

      app.get('/', function (req, res) { res.send('Hello World!'); })
When an HTTP GET request is made to the homepage of this web app, it returns “Hello World!”.

### React router
A tool that allows you to handle routes in a web app, using dynamic routing. Dynamic routing takes place as the app is rendering on your machine, unlike the old routing architecture where the routing is handled in a configuration outside of a running app. React router implements a component-based approach to routing. It provides different routing components according to the needs of the application and platform.
