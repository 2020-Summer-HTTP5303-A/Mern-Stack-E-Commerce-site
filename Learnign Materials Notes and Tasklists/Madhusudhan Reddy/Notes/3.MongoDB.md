# MongoDB
## What Is MongoDB?
 #### MongoDB is a document-oriented database. This means that it doesn’t use tables and rows to store its data, but instead collections of     JSON-like documents. These documents support embedded fields, so related data can be stored within them.

 #### MongoDB is also a schema-less database, so we don’t need to specify the number or type of columns before inserting our data.

## Here’s an example of what a MongoDB document might look like:
      {
        _id: ObjectId(3da252d3902a),
        type: "Tutorial",
        title: "An Introduction to MongoDB",
        author: "Manjunath M",
        tags: [ "mongodb", "compass", "crud" ],
         categories: [
              {
                   name: "javascript",
                   description: "Tutorialss on client-side and server-side JavaScript programming"
              },
              {
                    name: "databases",
                    description: "Tutorialss on different kinds of databases and their management"
              },
        ],
        content: "MongoDB is a cross-platform, open-source, NoSQL database..."
    }
